You buy the control tablet, wall keypads, door lock numeric push button keypads, smoke detectors, water detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, glass breaking detectors, outdoor/indoor camera(s), motion detector, wall mounted thermostat items in a bundle. I paid $600 for the initial bundle but needed to buy more than $300 extra. One perk is that you can arm/disarm your alarm system with your smartphone. As someone who knows too much about mobile device security or rather insecurity, it is only a matter of time before this feature is exploited. Minus two stars for a control tablet that has glitches. I cannot view my front door/exterior of my home because the tablet cannot receive the camera signals in real time ""live"" mode for more than a few minutes at a time. You need to restart the tablet & that takes a good bit of time so you cannot view who is ringing your doorbell outside when you want to. The tablet also has other features regarding the alarm system but the one I need the most is the real time camera, which does not work properly. A fix for the glitch has been in the works for over 8 months. The installer never told me that the thermostat that I did not want & did not order was already paid for in the bundle. So I returned it with delivery tracking but only discovered there would be no refund after AT&T received it & I called. AT&T did not offer to return it to me either. Be cognizant that you will be spending well over $1,000 for the equipment - I received one smart tablet, one outdoor camera + two wall keypads + one motion detector + two water detectors + two smart plugs (don't care about these things) + 1 window break detector + window open/close detectors sufficient to go on each side of window bottoms + thermostat + garage door open/close detector. Be aware that the detectors on the windows are attached with two sided foam tape & the detectors themselves are flat plastic squares. With slider windows (as opposed to casement windows) the top or bottom can be slid up (or down) to allow an intruder access. I thought that I had paid for all the window detectors but you need more for the top window; otherwise, only the bottom window moving will trigger the alarm.      If your installer arrives & you have the wrong door knob (I had a fancy Baldwin with a back plate) & he needs to return to finish the job because you need to find a different doorknob that will work with AT&T's illuminated push button door keypad, it will cost you an additional $135. Each visit. I agreed to an early install for a discount, not realizing that since I had not yet had my auto garage door device installed, that it would cost me more than the discount for the installer to return. The keypads were too small to cover the wall area where my former pads were, so old paint is now exposed. I no longer have this paint, so now I need to paint the entire room! Also, an owner cannot control the chime feature (beeps when door/window is opened/closed) from the keypad. Instead, the chime feature must either be completely off or on all the time and it must be performed from AT&T ""headquarters."" I called and requested that the chime feature be turned off but the request never occurred. I did not replace all my keypads since it was too expensive. So I have old alarm equipment still in place - two keypads & a motion detector just sitting there gathering dust. Also, the old smoke detectors from the previous alarm company were left in place. That is a first for me. I've had several alarm companies over the years, and they always removed the former monitoring company's equipment and installed the new equipment in its place. Not AT&T - it found a new spot & installed. Makes for a messy look.",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp

There was no explanation, no apology that they were out of stock, there was no communication whatsoever.- I have been with AT&T for over 20 years and the only reason why I consider staying is that I am grandfathered in on their unlimited data plan.

I'd also called them to make sure that they were showing June 11th, 2015 as my cancellation date same as what I had. They confirmed yes. So I'm like great, end of story. NOT. A month or so ago later I was still getting billed as if the service were still active. I called and they said no, its been turn off as scheduled, So why the bill I asked. The tell me that well, your contract ended on 6.1..2015 but that was only for the device and not the service. WTF is that supposed to mean. How would I know that I asked. She says well that is how any mobile service works no matter the carrier. News to me I said and I also wanted to know why that wasn't explained to me and how come the agent did not ask - do you want to stop the service too?  I had no use the service separately as AT&T is not my internet provider outside of the hot spot so how and why should I know that about the service part continuing. I have refused to pay it they turned over to collections. I have never canceled cell phone service so I had no idea that one (phone & service) has nothing to do with the other.

Um, no. So the number was on an account under the ""primary account holder"" who won't release the password, but was willing to release the phone.  Friday morning he walks into an AT&T store in Pennsylvania and releases the phone.  That evening we go into a store in Vegas and try to gain access, but their records show the account wasn't accessed (we were on the phone with him when he was in the store, he told the AT&T minion what he needed).  So we sit on the phone again that evening in the corporate store (3rd store we visited that day since we got referred to two incorrect locations to start) and again he goes through the process of releasing the phone - done!  Now she should be able to buy her own plan or control her number how she wants, right? Nope.  Saturday afternoon we are back in the store trying to figure out how to add her to an existing FamilyTalk plan, we are told it will be $18 and we can either make the ""primary account holder"" in CA walk into a store over there and do it, or we can do it online.  That sounds way better, we'll take time to research replacement phones then do it online since it's so simple.  Come Sunday morning we get online and start the process, only it isn't simple.  The online chat people are all unavailable. Can't even cue for them, just simply grayed out icons.  Then I call... 40 mins and 5 transfers later I'm talking to customer service representative who tells me we still can't transfer her phone to the FamilyTalk plan and keep her number because we don't have the password (remember how releasing the phone was supposed to give her the power to manage her number?  turns out that isn't quite true).  Oh, and the people over the phone can't help me (at a price of $18) because the FamilyTalk plan has a discount through work and the very separate and highly specialized business department at AT&T doesn't work or can't be bothered with client issues on Sundays.  That's exactly what you'd expect to hear from a multi-national corporation right?  And you want to file an official complaint, you expect an online, email, or call-in option for a TECH company?

Executives, I am assuming you ALL make a six-figure income as do I; and given ALL THE CONTINUING PROBLEMS communicating with AT&T, it is inexcusable in my opinion TO STILL BE DEMANDING (per Robert) AN UP-FRONT DEPOSIT AND FORCED BILL-PA",Negative,99.9999,1,Yelp

They are such a tear your hair out customer service nightmare of a company! Seriously. I still have the same connection problems from day 1 that no CSR can seem to solve or know what the hell their doing because another CSR clearly told me sending me a NEW modem/router IS NOT going to solve my problem (another CSR's solution)! Plus the hassle of me having to drop it off at the post office because I live in a townhome. Ahhhhh!!! =(Did I mention this happened in the course of LESS than a month? Then there's the time I called about the connection problems while driving so I didn't have the account information in front of me. The CSR transfers me to UVerse who cunningly (of course) did not solve my DSL problem but just prompted me to switch over to UVerse and ""I won't have those problems"". Then I see the email confirmation of a $29 activation fee and an additional $4 product fee? WHY wasn't I informed on the phone of this? I was wrongly transfered and then I was coerced to switch to a more expensive product as a ""SOLUTION""?When I received the email I called back (4 hours later) and canceled. They said okay. I got the darn  UVerse modem/router 2 days later. WHY?! They told me to return it to the UPS store and pretty much dodged the 2, 3 times I requested for a return label. Guess what? UPS didn't accept it and told me to contact AT&T for a return label... HOW MUCH OF A HASSLE HAS THIS BECOME FOR LESS THAN ONE MONTH? Hold time was almost an hour and I was hung up on/""disconnected""/dropped a few times. Too much. Not even worth the 12 month $25 DSL price plus $100 router/modem (another money maker because that dinky no namer brand router is NOT worth $100).I HATE AT&T and their ill trained customer service.

The customer service for this company was unacceptable before I encountered problems with my account and has continued to spiral down ever since. When I first purchased internet service, they sent me to router and it didn't work. I called to have the maintenance man come out and fix the cables. We set an appointment and he was a no show. I called again... he was a no show again. I ended up calling seven times before I finally received a visit from a technician. To my surprise, he had to schedule another type of technician to fix the problem. Upon arrival of my first bill, I was STILL unable to get an internet connection. Finally, after over a month I was able to log onto the internet. Next...Did you know that if you move across state lines you have to start new service first calling one number, then call another number to cancel the old service. Well... I didn't. Apparently I had two accounts for quite some time. So one day, I found out I was being billed for the old service address and new service address as well. I call a few times to rationally speak to someone about removing these changes, but they could never find my account. So instead of fighting it, I requested a statement be delivered to me to pay it off. After waiting for weeks, I never received it. I called back to see about a faxed or emailed statement instead. These guys tell me they are unable to email or fax things. I'm sure this was the case in 1994, but in 2011? Doubtful. The next time I called they must have received their first ever fax machine because they offered to fax a statement... until I gave them the area code. No, their fax machine can't send to Texas. So, to this day, I have not receive the information I've requested.  I've cried on the phone several times because of the extreme frustration.  It is a terrible thing when you call customer service and they don't even have notes on file as to how many times a customer has to call to get one thing accomplished.  As a manager at a call center, I have learned from this experience.  I tell my employees, ""Put yourself in the customer's shoes and DON'T EVER be like AT&T"" For the past year, I've told everyone I know to never use AT&T.  I took it to Facebook about six months ago and now as I continue to be absolutely disgusted by the repulsive excuse for customer service they deliver, I am now posting this review on every credible review site I know.

This past month I paid my bill as I always do, then about a week later I found that my service was shut off. When I called customer service I found that my payment had not gone through because they charged the bill to the wrong bank account. (One I had closed months before and had obviously not used for some time.) When I asked them to reprocess my payment with the correct bank account, I was informed that this would not restore my cellular service, I would need to pay the month in advance as well. Excuse me? I asked to speak to a supervisor, who stubbornly insisted on the same unreasonable demands to restore my cellular services, and informed me that there will be a $40 service restoration fee on my next bill. Outrageous. To add to this it took them most of the day before the service was restored after I paid the prior month and month to come. I have several phone lines on my account and they are needed for my family and I to have communication with each other and the world around us, and two of those lines are regrettably still under contract, else I would have terminated my service with these extortionists that very day. I will be leaving them in the dust the day those contracts expire.

,,,,, If this could have no stars it would. I am very disappointed after loyalty with ATT for years. After complaining of poor service I was told I could upgrade to a new iPhone by the retention dept and just had to go into the store - the store after waiting a long time told me only the retention dept could ship it. I go back to retention dept and can't get a response. &nbsp;I speak to chat customer rep and tell them I am going to leave and she tells me that I am eligible for an upgrade in a month at a discounted price. I stay. That month comes. &nbsp;They then tell me she was wrong and they would not honor her price despite the screen shots of the conversation I had. I emailed the CEO. An executive team member Mr Jonathan F accused me of altering the chat conversation. I complained in and email to CEO. A Mr john E from executive team calls and leaves a message. I call him back and he said he is busy and will call me back by 3. 5:00 comes and no call. I call him back. Voicemail is full. Never heard back. Emailed CEO again. No response. Some of the emails for ATT exes that were copied responded back not to contact them and remove from my email: poor customer service. ATT doesn't honor their word. ATT doesn't &nbsp;care about customer relations. ATT never follows up with customers. And the executive team should be ashamed for the lack of response and redirecting of blame they do.,Negative,100.0000,,
