Dallas10,32.953929,-96.821254,5100 Beltline Road Ste. 1032 ,4/17/2016,"Service is very inconsistent and the sales people are dishonest. If there were another pretty At&t store around the corner from me, I'd go there instead of here! There's not so I've been 4-5 times in the last 30 days, enough to know they need to do better. I can't say any of the times I visited, my needs were truly assessed. They generally looked for the fastest way to send me home. On my second visit, I was told to go home, turn my phone off then on again and he was sure it would be fine. Obviously it wasn't! I returned the same night, was greeted by seemingly helpful people who put my name in the system, and then I sat on the couch for more than 30 minutes. I thought I was okay but when the ipad they have hooked up near the couch had such slow service I could no longer stand to watch my favorite show, I left. Slow service on THEIR device in THEIR store is unacceptable. During another visit, I was told my account had a $107 credit balance and I could just not pay the next month. On my last visit, I was told that was very wrong and I owed $107 for the current month (my plan rate went up). Thanks for nothing.During each visit, they tried to sell me a new shiny phone with a new 2-year contract, preferably an iphone. The last visit turned out to be the most offensive. I bought my LG phone and insurance from Walmart with no contract then went to At&t to turn the phone on. They tried to sell me a G Pad as a special offer ""just for me"" (later told it's for anyone). I was repeatedly told it cost 99 cents. I asked if there would be more to pay and learned you pay like $10/month for 2 years. Even after that, they kept telling me what a great deal it was for 99 cents and every time they said the words 99 cents, I echoed, ""and $240"". The clerk brought in reinforcement to get all in my business and pretend she loved me then the reinforcement tried again to sell the 99 cents (and $240) gPad. The next thing she tried was selling me insurance that cost around $11/mo for 2 years plus a $199 deductible. I told her Walmart charged $59, covered more than what she told me they covered, and had a lower deductible. She told me another big difference in the plans is Walmart wouldn't offer the service of locking and erasing my phone if it was stolen but if I bought an at&t plan, they would. That almost got me but I wasn't really going to trust her. Today, I'm digging through my phone and discover that lock and erase service is FREE from at&t and already on my phone!The last thing they tried was to take away my unlimited text and data usage saying I never used anywhere near 5 gigs. When I was in a few weeks ago, the same guy who told me I had a $107 credit on my account showed me that I was using at least 4-5 gigs every month.When I went to the Yelp event, the store made me think I could put my mobile needs in their hands and be worry free. What I learned when I actually needed them is that everyone (even non techies like me) is required to do their own research and fact checking before arriving or get hosed!",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp

Two people held doors open for me when I arrived while a third greeted me to offer his assistance. The place is beautifully laid out with lots of staff, very clean, all phones on display, a cool looking service center, and a DirecTV area with a couch and some TV watching. They even have tables in the middle where staff can sit with you and your family to help you set your phone up without standing awkwardly at the counter.I went from here to a Sprint store where half the phones they have for sale weren't even on display and their Galaxy S5 that was on display had a cracked screen.That all said, you are paying for this nice store experience in your plan fees. My Sprint plan is $25/month cheaper than a comparable AT&T plan, and it's not worth $300/year to me to have nicer stores to visit.The one thing about this store that I didn't love is that they don't have any kind of brochure or literature I could take with me. So I had to remember all the details the guy was telling me and there was no way to write anything down or have a reference guide unless I brought my own pen/paper, which I didn't.

Of course I took up on that offer! My mom has been wanting an iPad so I just have it to her. My mom is old fashion and still use a flip phone.

A representative opened the door and greeted me with her friendly smile, and kindly told me I was the second person in line and my wait time was approximately 5 minutes.I was served by an knowledgeable representative and after he pressed a few buttons on his tablet, my voicemail had been reset.

I come to upgrade my iPhone on a corporate account and in order to backup the phone I need access to their internal network. They tell me the network is slow because there are so many devices connected to the network. The store is empty. There is still a line of people waiting. Keep in mind this is a network company who should have more bandwidth than any other type of company.Second: I just ordered gigapower. Gigapower is the fiber service designed to compete with google's gigabit service. I get 20 up and 100 down - that is not even close to gigapower. This is what makes people think that marketers are liars. Somewhere in some fine print they will tell you 300 megabit which is not close to 1gb and also far away from what I am actually getting for 120$. Now there is a promotion in my building but they still managed to bill me the full $110 fee. I asked the AT&T store for their help in understanding the quality of service and see how I can schedule a test and they said gigapower is too new for us and can you call the general number. How disconnected does a company have to be that they cannot help me with u-verse service but have no trouble trying to sell u-verse service in the store. I am now going back to Apple - I think they can help me much better. Wondering why I want to have my corporate account with AT&T. Time to look at Verizon.

Here is the saga:Phone drowned in a cup of coffee and we needed a replacement, no worries because it's a Thursday, we're in Vegas and it can be done quickly with all the stores around right? Um, no. So the number was on an account under the ""primary account holder"" who won't release the password, but was willing to release the phone. Friday morning he walks into an AT&T store in Pennsylvania and releases the phone. That evening we go into a store in Vegas and try to gain access, but their records show the account wasn't accessed (we were on the phone with him when he was in the store, he told the AT&T minion what he needed). So we sit on the phone again that evening in the corporate store (3rd store we visited that day since we got referred to two incorrect locations to start) and again he goes through the process of releasing the phone - done! Now she should be able to buy her own plan or control her number how she wants, right? Nope. Saturday afternoon we are back in the store trying to figure out how to add her to an existing FamilyTalk plan, we are told it will be $18 and we can either make the ""primary account holder"" in CA walk into a store over there and do it, or we can do it online. That sounds way better, we'll take time to research replacement phones then do it online since it's so simple. Come Sunday morning we get online and start the process, only it isn't simple. The online chat people are all unavailable. Can't even cue for them, just simply grayed out icons. Then I call... 40 mins and 5 transfers later I'm talking to customer service representative who tells me we still can't transfer her phone to the FamilyTalk plan and keep her number because we don't have the password (remember how releasing the phone was supposed to give her the power to manage her number? turns out that isn't quite true). Oh, and the people over the phone can't help me (at a price of $18) because the FamilyTalk plan has a discount through work and the very separate and highly specialized business department at AT&T doesn't work or can't be bothered with client issues on Sundays. That's exactly what you'd expect to hear from a multi-national corporation right? And you want to file an official complaint, you expect an online, email, or call-in option for a TECH company?

That's exactly what every tech-savy multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation corporation should be doing demonstrate their commitment to customer care. This needs a very, very hard re-think by AT&T. It's really no wonder that they rank at the bottom of customer care in every region of the country.

Over $1800 worth of equipment

in june a technician came and installed my service. Once completed he told me that he couldnt install the light switches due to him not being a licensed electrician and advised me to call customer service. I had some remodeling done to my house so i called and scheduled the handy man to come in the begining of july and thats when everything went down hill. 

The tech came at the scheduled time, when he showed up he said "" i dont know what went wrong but you need a handy man i can not help you, so he put in an order for a handy man to come in couple of days later.

couple of days later samething happened a tech came and said i dont know what went wrong but you need a handy man. 

So after three times of sending the wrong people. A handy man showed up august 11. he was supposed to show up at 4 but he showed up at 8 PM. he installed the switches and asked me to try one out, i asked him how can i dim my lights he said "" OH these are ions or something of that sort and you can only turn them on and off and not dim them."" he advised me to call customer service and left after installing 19 out of the 20 switches. 

Next day my lights started acting up. The minute you turn on the lights they turn back off in my kitchen and entry way. and 7 out of the switches have not been syned.

Thats fine i call customer service they send a tech and again "" i dont know what happened you need a handy man, call customer service and tell them that they sent you the wrong switches. I said ok, i called customer service and then got transfered 3 times until i got someone that said ok we will come and replace them. an hour before installation the supervisor calls and tells me that i have no handy man is available we will reschedule, i said ok.

Today again an hour before installation the tech calls me and informs me that i need a handy man so i told him that when i talked to support they said they will send one, so he said he is going to call robert his supervisor. 5 min later he calls me and tells me that if i want the dimmers i have to purchase them again full price and that i need to pay an electrician to come and install them. i told him thats not what they told me at support so he advised me to call. So i call again and after 1.5 hours the lady tells me to pay  $20 extra per switch and someone between 4 and 7 will come and install so i agreed. GUESS WHAT. i get a call back before installation and the gentleman tells me that there is no order for a handy man and that i should pay my electrician to come and install them, so i put him on three way with support and they told him to get a handy man, well wait its too late now you have to wait another 3 business days before a handy man comes and installs them. 

I told the lady ( Fellan ) her name that i want to cancel the service because they couldnt deliver the product, so she states that i have to pay an early termination fee of 631 dollars. Wait What???!??!?!?!

1. They sent the wrong switches
2. I have been waiting for 1.5 month 
3. My lights in my brand new built house are not working 
4. i still have to pay for that.???? 
5. not to mention that this is how they left my house

Yes sir you have to, i will try to get a supervisor to call you but that usually takes 24-48 hours..

This is my story:
In January of this year, I moved to my current address. In the process of moving, I contacted several cable providers to see which one I would want to use in my new apartment. I contacted Comcast, AT&T, and DirecTV. After deciding that I wanted to stay with Comcast, I went forward with them and they installed my cable. The AT&T representative that I spoke to on the phone kept calling me back, because we never finished discussing anything about installation or prices - I was only wanting some general information about the service they provide. She continued to call me back and I never responded because I didn't want the service. She should have taken the fact that I didn't respond as an obvious sign that I was not interested; instead, she used my information to create an AT&T account, and set me up for an installation that I never asked for or agreed to. A few days later, I received a call from AT&T saying that I was scheduled for an installation. I told them that I never asked for one, and that I didn't want AT&T's service because by that point, I had Comcast. They asked if I wanted to cancel the installation, and I said yes so they did. About a month later, AT&T sends me a bill - for what, I do not know. I NEVER installed their service in my home, so how was I being billed for something that I never used? That same day, February 19th, I called AT&T and explained my situation. They could not find an account under my name because I never had one, so they could not figure out how I was being billed. After being on the phone with them for over two hours, I finally spoke to their supervisor, who apologized for the inconvenience I was experiencing.... but guess what?

It's fiber optic from their main station to your ""neighborhood terminal"" /box,  then it is nothing but copper telephone line to your house.  I live in Old East Dallas and so they have tried to get away with installing as few terminals as possible. Because of that I am 5,000 feet away from my box. When the guy showed up to install the Uverse he told me off the record that there was no point in getting any faster internet than the basic because the copper lines would not support it.  He was not only right, it won't even support the basic.

Tech 1 comes out and finds the problem, he then says he can't fix it because the problem is not in his small area, so someone else will call and ""re-schedule"" another appointment with tech #2 even though tech #1 has just determined the problem. So instead of tech #2 reading off tech #1's work order and just fixing the problem, you have to be at home for tech #2 and then he will check the same damn stuff again.  Then tech #2 will say, "" I'm sorry, but the problem is further upstream and not in my area""  ""someone will call you and ""re-schedule"" for the ""line"" tech to come out"".  So then tech #3 calls and, once again, you have to be home. He then checks the same stuff the other two techs checked (at your house) and then leaves, and in my case didn't even call me back to tell me if it was fixed or not.  So, I call again and went through tech #5. and NOW tech #6 is telling me that the problem is at the pole, which is strange because tech #1 replaced all the stuff on the pole.

I was moving about a mile away from my previous apartment.  I called and scheduled a transfer to the new place for the first day I was to move in.  I was informed my modem wouldn't work at the new place and I would be required to rent one, I'm not happy about this, but I had other things to worry about with the move.

So the technician shows up and informs me that he needs to wait on another technician before he can start.  Long story short, the other guy never showed up.  He advised me  to just schedule for another day.  I do this, but they can't come out for another week.  Next week, a technician shows up, he says he can start but can't complete the job until another technician shows up.  We wait 5 hours and another no show.  He says the other guy just needs to do something outside and is scheduled to come by and I'll be notified when it's done.

Then it gets really bad, I start getting voicemails everyday asking me to call in and schedule an installation.  When I return the call I'm advised I don't need to schedule an installation, just keep waiting and a technician should be out within a few days to complete.  Everyday I get voicemails.  It always goes to voicemail because the iphone 5 AT&T charged me out the nose for typically doesn't ring and I miss the majority of my calls.  After dozens of phone calls back and forth, now all of a sudden, they can't pull up my account when I give them my number.  This culminates with a call center experience around the world speaking with Americans, Indians, etc.  This call ends after 38 minutes when I realized the 4th time I've been transferred it's been to the wrong department.

Many, many calls later, and dealing personally with an AT&T rep who my apartment building pays to assist the residents to get service, we finally determine the number they have on file for me was altered by one digit.  I ask for this to be corrected and once again schedule a technician to come out.  Well it appears customer service has my correct number, but the technician doesn't.  So he can't contact me.  A 4th technician is scheduled to come out and I ask he's given the correct number, he is not.  He shows up and can't contact me.

I'm nearing 4 weeks since I moved, around 50 phone calls, 4 technician visits, 2 where I let them in my apartment, and still no service yet.  Meanwhile I'm racking up huge data bills on my phone, which doesn't ring when friends and family and technicians call.  I'm being told I will be forced to rent a modem (no option of buying) that has a ranking on Amazon of 2 starts and runs for about $20 to buy outright.

Also, I haven't even seen a bill in over year since I switched to paperless billing.  Now when I login, I need to synch my Uverse bill to my cellphone bill.  Guess what?  I gave up trying to get it synched after 5 calls to customer support where we reset the password and it didn't work.  I can't even review my bill to understand why I'm paying $170 per month to have a cell phone line and home internet,  NO TV!!

Nothing more to say, but complete and utter dysfunction.

They told me that they were going to have to send me out a new DVR and when I get the old one, I have to return it to a UPS store within 10 days (or get billed for it).  Ok.. starting to get upset... How is this my fault?

Then, I tell them that I want to be reimbursed for the movies I lost.  12 movies that I have not yet watched by $6/movie, I asked for $72.  Their answer was that they would give me a $30 credit, but that is it.  Again, how is this my fault and why do I pay $135/month for this crap?!

Is your internet slow when you have UVERSE TV on? Mine too. 

AT&T seems to have established levels that you have to fight through as a customer. It's starts in the US, transfers to the real Battle Roya in India where the Customer Service rep defends their terms, then to the customer service rep's manager and then back to America when you're ready to cancel they give you pretty much what you were asking for originally.

It's annoying and a terrible experience. When did it become acceptable to nickel and dime your customers? Thanks cell phone companies.

If your UVERSE internet seems slow it's because when your TV is on the internet slows down. I split service providers. Works well now.

Instead of upsetting the Customer Rep in India - just do their little dance get to the manager and then tell them you want cancel your service and get to the cancellation process and see if they can resolve your issue.

OH - and make sure to review AT&T while waiting on the phone and during your discussion. Google, Bing, Yahoo, Amazon - one comment can have huge impacts.

Stay alway from them, if you still want a Iphone, you still can, Buy the unlock ver, i know its expensive but at the end it will pay off in a few months of service with them.

The customer service for this company was unacceptable before I encountered problems with my account and has continued to spiral down ever since. When I first purchased internet service, they sent me to router and it didn't work. I called to have the maintenance man come out and fix the cables. We set an appointment and he was a no show. I called again... he was a no show again. I ended up calling seven times before I finally received a visit from a technician. To my surprise, he had to schedule another type of technician to fix the problem. Upon arrival of my first bill, I was STILL unable to get an internet connection. Finally, after over a month I was able to log onto the internet. Next...Did you know that if you move across state lines you have to start new service first calling one number, then call another number to cancel the old service. Well... I didn't. Apparently I had two accounts for quite some time. So one day, I found out I was being billed for the old service address and new service address as well. I call a few times to rationally speak to someone about removing these changes, but they could never find my account. So instead of fighting it, I requested a statement be delivered to me to pay it off. After waiting for weeks, I never received it. I called back to see about a faxed or emailed statement instead. These guys tell me they are unable to email or fax things. I'm sure this was the case in 1994, but in 2011? Doubtful. The next time I called they must have received their first ever fax machine because they offered to fax a statement... until I gave them the area code. No, their fax machine can't send to Texas. So, to this day, I have not receive the information I've requested.  I've cried on the phone several times because of the extreme frustration.  It is a terrible thing when you call customer service and they don't even have notes on file as to how many times a customer has to call to get one thing accomplished.  As a manager at a call center, I have learned from this experience.  I tell my employees, ""Put yourself in the customer's shoes and DON'T EVER be like AT&T"" For the past year, I've told everyone I know to never use AT&T.

Dallas1,32.779555,-96.8009703,"208 S Akard Street, Ste 110, Dallas, TX 75202",8/12/2016,"AT&T new alarm system that it installs & monitors for about $68 per month after base price + fees/tax. You buy the control tablet, wall keypads, door lock numeric push button keypads, smoke detectors, water detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, glass breaking detectors, outdoor/indoor camera(s), motion detector, wall mounted thermostat items in a bundle. I paid $600 for the initial bundle but needed to buy more than $300 extra. One perk is that you can arm/disarm your alarm system with your smartphone. As someone who knows too much about mobile device security or rather insecurity, it is only a matter of time before this feature is exploited. Minus two stars for a control tablet that has glitches. I cannot view my front door/exterior of my home because the tablet cannot receive the camera signals in real time ""live"" mode for more than a few minutes at a time. You need to restart the tablet & that takes a good bit of time so you cannot view who is ringing your doorbell outside when you want to. The tablet also has other features regarding the alarm system but the one I need the most is the real time camera, which does not work properly. A fix for the glitch has been in the works for over 8 months. The installer never told me that the thermostat that I did not want & did not order was already paid for in the bundle. So I returned it with delivery tracking but only discovered there would be no refund after AT&T received it & I called. AT&T did not offer to return it to me either. Be cognizant that you will be spending well over $1,000 for the equipment - I received one smart tablet, one outdoor camera + two wall keypads + one motion detector + two water detectors + two smart plugs (don't care about these things) + 1 window break detector + window open/close detectors sufficient to go on each side of window bottoms + thermostat + garage door open/close detector. Be aware that the detectors on the windows are attached with two sided foam tape & the detectors themselves are flat plastic squares. With slider windows (as opposed to casement windows) the top or bottom can be slid up (or down) to allow an intruder access. I thought that I had paid for all the window detectors but you need more for the top window; otherwise, only the bottom window moving will trigger the alarm.   If your installer arrives & you have the wrong door knob (I had a fancy Baldwin with a back plate) & he needs to return to finish the job because you need to find a different doorknob that will work with AT&T's illuminated push button door keypad, it will cost you an additional $135. Each visit. I agreed to an early install for a discount, not realizing that since I had not yet had my auto garage door device installed, that it would cost me more than the discount for the installer to return. The keypads were too small to cover the wall area where my former pads were, so old paint is now exposed. I no longer have this paint, so now I need to paint the entire room! Also, an owner cannot control the chime feature (beeps when door/window is opened/closed) from the keypad. Instead, the chime feature must either be completely off or on all the time and it must be performed from AT&T ""headquarters."" I called and requested that the chime feature be turned off but the request never occurred. I did not replace all my keypads since it was too expensive. So I have old alarm equipment still in place - two keypads & a motion detector just sitting there gathering dust. Also, the old smoke detectors from the previous alarm company were left in place. That is a first for me. I've had several alarm companies over the years, and they always removed the former monitoring company's equipment and installed the new equipment in its place. Not AT&T - it found a new spot & installed. Makes for a messy look.",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp

I am a pretty easy going person and have owned several business's over the years. I understand that all business have issues. BUT with many times of contact with AT&T they are the most consistent company I have ever done business with that every contact you want to rip someone's head off. They have NEVER done what was promised when they said it would be completed.Again this week they have disappointed me again. And I know you ask if I hate them why do business with them. I need a plain old analog phone line and cant use a VOIP or digital line and they are the only provider to my home.It is really amazing to me that a company that large can have such a poor consistent customer service presence in the market.But that is not the worst of the story......  Their will be no one who cares at AT&T. There will be no one in the entire organization that cares or if they care the monster is so large they can't make a difference.All of this starts at the TOP... the management needs to be changed from the top down. clean the rats out of the barn and you might need to burn the barn down to accomplish the task.It is always amazing that no one there ever cares how bad it is.,Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

(Insert despair emojicon.)3) Allowed me to question what I did in my past life to deserve this kind of abuse.4) Encouraged me to think about plunging a pair of chopsticks through one of my eyes. (I'm Asian, and that's why I have chopsticks.) Oh, and I forgot that my girlfriend actually started this three-hour marathon, but lost her mind midway through and then gave the phone to me. Why?

I asked if I could go to a local AT&T retail store and ask for a white iphone 5 there and exchange it, the insurance representative said no because they are different companies.Here is what I don't understand:- Why wasn't I notified that I would receive the yellow instead of what I ordered? There was no explanation, no apology that they were out of stock, there was no communication whatsoever.- I have been with AT&T for over 20 years and the only reason why I consider staying is that I am grandfathered in on their unlimited data plan.

They have failed because they partnered with an insurance agency that does not look out for their customer and does nothing to make sure their customers are taken care of.Listen, in the big picture this is a small issue but don't you think for all the money I am spending yearly that I should be able to get the phone I requested?

Considering that my Great-Grand Mother Pearl Chenoweth Bell was the daughter of Alexander Graham Bell, I'll take the FTR. :)   Yes, Alexander Graham Bell is my Great Great Grandfather. Great Great Grandpa helped to invent one of the first practical phones. Don't know anything about it as I wasn't there but what he did was cool.  He would have likely rolled over in his grave if he knew of the commercial gains that would come at a cost. See, the telephone companies suppressed global communications for a profit which to me was a crime against humanity. Social-Economic terrorism I do believe.  And I did my part to fight it.  When Scotland Yard, US Secret Service and 9 other agencies kicked down the door of my house on October 10th 1993 in Houston and seized everything I owned, it was due to the fact that myself and hundreds of others around the world set up an Internet. Complete with E-Mail, all using Commodore 64 computers.  From 1984-1993 we hacked the ever loving hell out of phone lines, trunk lines, AT&T conferences and we met people all over the world free, as it always should have been.  In fact had I not been a Phreaker, one of the most notorious in the world I would have never met the people overseas that ended up introducing me to my wife from Japan.  Glad I did it.  I am in fact Grego formerly of Illusion.So there's ya some history. I paid my price. $70,000.00 which was chump change.The AT&T Global HQ in Dallas, right here is actually three building thats comprise a complex.  Observed large amounts of workers with badges from all over the world whom seem to stimulate the downtown economy with such simple things as frequenting restaurants.  The Global HQ also displays ""Golden Boy"" also known as the ""Spirit of Communications"", an 18,000 pound golden statue that started in 1914 in New York City.  He's here, in fact here is his wiki;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpAT&T HQ is open to the public and is an interesting place to visit.  Where mankind has commercialized communications of modern date.

I am coming up on 25 days since they installed service.  It is still not working. TV programs. We watched Modern Family where the sound was 4 seconds behind the video feed. It is typical for TV programs to freeze. The internet drops constantly. It cannot maintain a VPN. The phone is garbled. If you have a home office the service makes it impossible to work. We had over 9 different AT&T techs. We have 4 inside techs and 5 line, external techs. The customer service is horrendous. The customer rep that I reached made me go through each of the 30 question and checks. Even though they just checked it on Tuesday.

I was incredibly clear in explaining how I was moving and wanted to transfer my service. It took me one month (basically, one billing cycle) to find out that they didn't transfer my service, but opened a new account. I figured this must be some type of innocent mistake so I paid both bills, called customer service and had them close the account. They insisted everything was complete and I was down to one account. This month I received another two bills: one for my current service and one for the service that was supposedly stopped. For two months this company has strung me out and billed me for extra services. They are terrible and incompetent. I had Time Warner before this and when I cancelled with them (on the recommendation of a friend) it was simple. No extra charges, no two months of billing for ghost accounts. And they knew I was leaving them completely instead of just transferring services! I'm the only person on my block with AT&T.

They said we were ""prioritized "" yesterday to install our service. That was a load of crap. They never showed up, again. What a surprise! We called again last night when they didn't show up, and they said they would be here between 9 and 10 AM FIRST THING this morning. AGAIN! They did not show up, for a third time. Not only did my mother and I take off work yesterday with a combined total of $800 loss in pay, now I took off work again today losing more money for a company that still hasn't shown up. They have now promised, for a 4th time, to show up today between 1 and 3 PM. They haven't offered any kind of compensation for our horrible customer service experience.

                Updated review","I've been meaning to write and post this about my experience with AT&T for a few months now. I have always and have only ever subscribed to AT&T for cell phone and also for a wifi hotspot device and service. I started it in June 2013 and ended the contract June 11th, 2015 faithfully. I ended it because I no longer needed the service. I'd also called them to make sure that they were showing June 11th, 2015 as my cancellation date same as what I had. They confirmed yes. So I'm like great, end of story. NOT. A month or so ago later I was still getting billed as if the service were still active. I called and they said no, its been turn off as scheduled, So why the bill I asked. The tell me that well, your contract ended on 6.1..2015 but that was only for the device and not the service. WTF is that supposed to mean. How would I know that I asked. She says well that is how any mobile service works no matter the carrier. News to me I said and I also wanted to know why that wasn't explained to me and how come the agent did not ask - do you want to stop the service too? I had no use the service separately as AT&T is not my internet provider outside of the hot spot so how and why should I know that about the service part continuing. I have refused to pay it they turned over to collections. I have never canceled cell phone service so I had no idea that one (phone & service) has nothing to do with the other. I've told everyone at work this and friends and much to my surprise this is not a unique issue and many said that they would never use AT&T anyway.

Here is the saga:Phone drowned in a cup of coffee and we needed a replacement, no worries because it's a Thursday, we're in Vegas and it can be done quickly with all the stores around right? Um, no. So the number was on an account under the ""primary account holder"" who won't release the password, but was willing to release the phone. Friday morning he walks into an AT&T store in Pennsylvania and releases the phone. That evening we go into a store in Vegas and try to gain access, but their records show the account wasn't accessed (we were on the phone with him when he was in the store, he told the AT&T minion what he needed). So we sit on the phone again that evening in the corporate store (3rd store we visited that day since we got referred to two incorrect locations to start) and again he goes through the process of releasing the phone - done! Now she should be able to buy her own plan or control her number how she wants, right? Nope. Saturday afternoon we are back in the store trying to figure out how to add her to an existing FamilyTalk plan, we are told it will be $18 and we can either make the ""primary account holder"" in CA walk into a store over there and do it, or we can do it online. That sounds way better, we'll take time to research replacement phones then do it online since it's so simple. Come Sunday morning we get online and start the process, only it isn't simple. The online chat people are all unavailable. Can't even cue for them, just simply grayed out icons. Then I call... 40 mins and 5 transfers later I'm talking to customer service representative who tells me we still can't transfer her phone to the FamilyTalk plan and keep her number because we don't have the password (remember how releasing the phone was supposed to give her the power to manage her number? turns out that isn't quite true). Oh, and the people over the phone can't help me (at a price of $18) because the FamilyTalk plan has a discount through work and the very separate and highly specialized business department at AT&T doesn't work or can't be bothered with client issues on Sundays. That's exactly what you'd expect to hear from a multi-national corporation right? And you want to file an official complaint, you expect an online, email, or call-in option for a TECH company? Nope, I'm told to mail a letter to:AT&T Mobility Customer CarePO BOX 755Atwater, CA 95301Sure, that makes sense. That's exactly what every tech-savy multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation corporation should be doing demonstrate their commitment to customer care. This needs a very, very hard re-think by AT&T. It's really no wonder that they rank at the bottom of customer care in every region of the country. The cell service is fine, but taking 3 days to jump through all of their hoops, get conflicting information about what needs to be done, and ultimately end up with nothing is disrespectful to their client base.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

When I asked them to reprocess my payment with the correct bank account, I was informed that this would not restore my cellular service, I would need to pay the month in advance as well. Excuse me? I asked to speak to a supervisor, who stubbornly insisted on the same unreasonable demands to restore my cellular services, and informed me that there will be a $40 service restoration fee on my next bill. Outrageous. To add to this it took them most of the day before the service was restored after I paid the prior month and month to come.

I can not run a business with a @yahoo or @hotmail, I need a real e-mail from an alleged professional company. Turns out AT&T runs e-mail through Yahoo. WHY? It is time for AT&T to get with the times. My company has gone from 0% e-mail communication to 70%. AT&T needs to get with the program or go back to wired phone service.

The customer service for this company was unacceptable before I encountered problems with my account and has continued to spiral down ever since. When I first purchased internet service, they sent me to router and it didn't work. I called to have the maintenance man come out and fix the cables. We set an appointment and he was a no show. I called again... he was a no show again. I ended up calling seven times before I finally received a visit from a technician. To my surprise, he had to schedule another type of technician to fix the problem. Upon arrival of my first bill, I was STILL unable to get an internet connection. Finally, after over a month I was able to log onto the internet. Next...Did you know that if you move across state lines you have to start new service first calling one number, then call another number to cancel the old service. Well... I didn't. Apparently I had two accounts for quite some time. So one day, I found out I was being billed for the old service address and new service address as well. I call a few times to rationally speak to someone about removing these changes, but they could never find my account. So instead of fighting it, I requested a statement be delivered to me to pay it off. After waiting for weeks, I never received it. I called back to see about a faxed or emailed statement instead. These guys tell me they are unable to email or fax things. I'm sure this was the case in 1994, but in 2011? Doubtful. The next time I called they must have received their first ever fax machine because they offered to fax a statement... until I gave them the area code. No, their fax machine can't send to Texas. So, to this day, I have not receive the information I've requested. I've cried on the phone several times because of the extreme frustration. It is a terrible thing when you call customer service and they don't even have notes on file as to how many times a customer has to call to get one thing accomplished. As a manager at a call center, I have learned from this experience. I tell my employees, ""Put yourself in the customer's shoes and DON'T EVER be like AT&T"" For the past year, I've told everyone I know to never use AT&T.

When I asked them to reprocess my payment with the correct bank account, I was informed that this would not restore my cellular service, I would need to pay the month in advance as well. Excuse me? I asked to speak to a supervisor, who stubbornly insisted on the same unreasonable demands to restore my cellular services, and informed me that there will be a $40 service restoration fee on my next bill. Outrageous. To add to this it took them most of the day before the service was restored after I paid the prior month and month to come. I have several phone lines on my account and they are needed for my family and I to have communication with each other and the world around us, and two of those lines are regrettably still under contract, else I would have terminated my service with these extortionists that very day.

I go back to retention dept and can't get a response. &nbsp;I speak to chat customer rep and tell them I am going to leave and she tells me that I am eligible for an upgrade in a month at a discounted price. I stay. That month comes. &nbsp;They then tell me she was wrong and they would not honor her price despite the screen shots of the conversation I had. I emailed the CEO. An executive team member Mr Jonathan F accused me of altering the chat conversation. I complained in and email to CEO. A Mr john E from executive team calls and leaves a message. I call him back and he said he is busy and will call me back by 3. 5:00 comes and no call. I call him back. Voicemail is full. Never heard back. Emailed CEO again. No response. Some of the emails for ATT exes that were copied responded back not to contact them and remove from my email: poor customer service. ATT doesn't honor their word. ATT doesn't &nbsp;care about customer relations. ATT never follows up with customers.

The manager at the Oak Lawn location where I bought the phone wouldn't even return my calls on the matter. The first time I called, he said he'd look info the issue and see what he could do.

I wanted to sell it to Gizelle even though they were offering $75 less. Because I know how quickly Gizele sends your cash for your phone. It is ultimately a no hassle program and they are very friendly.Well, the moral of story is that AT&T has your phone after you've mailed it to them for now a month plus a few days and still can't give you an answer as to when you'll get the AT&T cash card. When you track it on-line the ""status"" still says ""phone not received"" even though when you call them they say that they have it. ????

Here is the saga:Phone drowned in a cup of coffee and we needed a replacement, no worries because it's a Thursday, we're in Vegas and it can be done quickly with all the stores around right? Um, no. So the number was on an account under the ""primary account holder"" who won't release the password, but was willing to release the phone. Friday morning he walks into an AT&T store in Pennsylvania and releases the phone. That evening we go into a store in Vegas and try to gain access, but their records show the account wasn't accessed (we were on the phone with him when he was in the store, he told the AT&T minion what he needed). So we sit on the phone again that evening in the corporate store (3rd store we visited that day since we got referred to two incorrect locations to start) and again he goes through the process of releasing the phone - done! Now she should be able to buy her own plan or control her number how she wants, right? Nope. Saturday afternoon we are back in the store trying to figure out how to add her to an existing FamilyTalk plan, we are told it will be $18 and we can either make the ""primary account holder"" in CA walk into a store over there and do it, or we can do it online. That sounds way better, we'll take time to research replacement phones then do it online since it's so simple. Come Sunday morning we get online and start the process, only it isn't simple. The online chat people are all unavailable. Can't even cue for them, just simply grayed out icons. Then I call... 40 mins and 5 transfers later I'm talking to customer service representative who tells me we still can't transfer her phone to the FamilyTalk plan and keep her number because we don't have the password (remember how releasing the phone was supposed to give her the power to manage her number? turns out that isn't quite true). Oh, and the people over the phone can't help me (at a price of $18) because the FamilyTalk plan has a discount through work and the very separate and highly specialized business department at AT&T doesn't work or can't be bothered with client issues on Sundays.

That's exactly what every tech-savy multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporation corporation should be doing demonstrate their commitment to customer care.

Fortunately, the sales associates here went up, over, and beyond my expectations. I walked up and I had two greeters open the doors for me.

(which I happily paid to have my phone on the spot). I walked out of there feeling pretty boss. Even the lady expediting the release of my ported number said ""don't worry, we won't let this division bully you."" Such endearment! About a week later, I got my first bill...

The sales associate was very discouraging on a transfer and insistent on opening a new account. I ask for the manager and he was no help.

Sounds strange, but this phone number has been in the family for over 50 years (minus the area code of course). We had a recent death in the family, so it was important we keep the number; we explained all of this to JJ, who provided the absolute best customer service. We were there for 2 hours, and while this is a long time, JJ was on his feet the whole time helping us every way he could. First AT&T wanted to charge us a cancellation fee for the cell phone, which doesn't make sense since the person passed away. He managed to go around that fee, as well as others, and we finally got the number switched.

I use about 200 texts a day! so by day three, sure enough, I got a warning text saying I went over my texting limit plus 50 bucks. FIFTY DOLLARS? oh no, I dont think so!

With each merger the accountability and customer service has diminished.  At the same time, ATT implements questionable tactics to get rid of customers with older, less profitable rate plans and deceives customers into changing plans by lying about pricing &amp; features.  Any Netflix customer should be concerned about the pending ATT/Directv merger.  This merger will make ATT the largest pay TV provider with substantial broadband reach. \ ATT%  ability to limit competition in online video market will increase. It would be impressive to see consumers unite to file a petition to deny the merger. After the merger ATT would have great power over services like Netflix b/c  they can interfere with the customers use of streaming services  and a company like Netflix wouldn%u2019t have much recourse.

I would like to begin by letting you know that I created a Google Plus account just so that I can warn  about one of the absolute worse experience I have ever had, in any type of consumer environment. If you do plan to ""try it"" then bear this in mind: Everyone in this particular location are sale sharks. Whatever your problem may be, no one employed there treats you like a valued customer. Similar to vicious car salesmen, they only will try to manipulate money out of you. Example: I went in to get an upgrade and was kept being pushed into contracts. When I expressed getting out of the contract, oh well there's a fees. Turns out, when I spoke to corporate, every contract has a 14 day grace period. Once the sales people realized that I wasn't buying the crap they were selling, I started getting attitude! I wasn't being rude, or even out of line, I was simply contesting what they kept telling me. Even when I spoke to the manager about my concerns, she gave me an attitude and was unwilling to help. I work in customer service, and this was pathetic. If I could, based on customer service alone, this location deserves less than even no stars. New rating: negative 5 stars. This store is literally filled with a bunch of pretentious 20 something year olds, hopping around more concerned with goofing off with each other instead of helping customers. So expect 15-45 minute wait regardless of the amount of customers in the store. Also, the individual sales people don't know anything about the products they're pushing so hard to sell. Several times during a conversation the manager needs to be personally asked. Well I'm not surprised since all these assholes care about is the compensation they receive from a sale. If this wasn't connected to a national phone service and it was a personal business, the incompetence and forcefulness of the people on the floor would piss people off enough to complain and the bitchy manager would make sure to permanently destroy the business. I personally warn you to know EXACTLY what you want, and need or expect to be pimped. ",Negative,100.0000,2,Google

I went there to get deposits waived while transferring a bunch of phones to my plan to consolidate our two family plans. The guy who ""helped"" me kept having to go get help from someone then that he couldn't waive the deposit, I insisted that he could do that and back he went to the back of the store. 

Finally he started to do it and informed me of an $18/phone fee for transferring responsibility. I had been told over the phone that I could get that fee waived, so I asked for that. The guy insisted that he ""literally cannot do that."" I pointed to the ""waive fee"" checkbox on his tablet interface and insisted that he could do it. Finally had to talk to a manager who said he would do what I wanted ""tomorrow"" and almost a week later nothing had changed.

The two stars are for the amusement of seeing classic bureaucratic dishonest customer service try to be cool, hip and modern. ",Negative,100.0000,1,Google

Flashback to last week. I had an iphone that I had hastily set up by the customer service rep the day before that was acting up. We thought it was a pretty simple fix and just wanted to double check with them before we fixed it.We show up at 7:30, roughly 1.5 hours until they close. We explained the simply problem to the customer service rep. Oh boy. She had no clue what to do and had us get in line. There were 3 people ahead of us. We go and mess around on the ipads and wait our turn. Over an hour goes by.During the hour, we're seeing names disappear from the top of the list. But we're staying still at 3 behind. Then my name disappears entirely. It's then that we go to a rep to see what the deal is. He said that they were looking for me and couldn't find me. There were only about 10 customers in the store, including us, so they didn't look enough apparently. And when we begrudgingly asked our simply problem for verification on the solution we had in mind, the rep said ""of course"" and wondered why the other rep even put us in line.They're batting .500 for good experiences, so another good one might bump them to 3 stars.",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp

I've bought my last 4 new iPhones for our account from this store, but I missed the 14 day return policy to return an unused case that they hard-sold us on but which my son didn't actually want. Were they understanding? I mean I've only been an AT&T customer for 13 years, and had Uverse for something like 6 years. I guess none of that means shit so they basically told me to F off with a smile on their face. Seriously? I was inside one month on the return but hell, the policy is 14 days, and ""they won't let us do anything about that"". Deep breath...at least my immediate call to AT&T's customer service line and a REASONABLE human being got me a bill credit for the $54 the case cost and solved my problem, but if you go here be prepared for a hard sell on the phone case and a glass screen cover so decide in advance if you want it or be prepared to return that stuff stat if you don't. Whew...I feel better venting but what a bunch of inflexible smiling A holes they have who don't give a damn about customer service. Maybe I'm being a petulant jerk myself- they have a policy and it is what it is. But still, the way they conveyed their ""can't do anything for you"" message with a smile like they enjoyed telling me no is what got under my skin.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp

They said to check out Apple and see if Apple could replace the phone, if Apple shouldn't then they said that this particular AT&T had the phone that I needed in inventory and they should be able to exchange it.Went to Apple and they said that if they replace it and it will shorten the warranty. That physical damage is actually the responsibility of AT&T to exchange. Regarding the exchange policy, this is along the lines of what the AT&T at Lemmon said (they didn't know about the warranty issue). The AT&T at Lemmon actually even put a note concerning this iPhone in the system talking about how it was dead upon arrival and that I should be able to get a new phone. The management here decided to ignore this and just lied to me and say that they couldn't exchange the phone. I don't know if the employees are aware of this or this is coming from the top down but this AT&T store does not understand how things should work concerning Apple phones.

He basically told me that my only option was to pay the remaining amount for my broken phone for $435 and then do another att next deal. Not happening!

""well maybe you shouldn't be so rough on your phone and it wouldn't break *stare and giggle*"" and ""it wouldn't break in a case, maybe you should use one"" which I quickly told him it was in a case when it broke.

A saleswoman named Amy Jones (full title The Magically Disappearing Amy Jones, although I didn't know it at the time) showed me some phones I might be interested in.When I finally settled on a pretty red one (comparing colors is also the method I use to pick football teams to cheer for), she went back to the storeroom to get it. She shortly re-emerged to say that they were out of the red color, but the black was in stock, and I could take it for now and then come back in two weeks to trade it for the red one. I was VERY careful to make sure that there would be no extra charges for this; she assured me it would be a piece of cake. A free piece of cake. A la mode. It sounded wonderful.She EVEN gave me her business card and wrote her private cell phone on it. She promised (multiple times, because I didn't believe her and made her repeat it multiple times) that she would call me the minute the red ones were in stock.So, I leave the store with a substantially lighter wallet and a phone I don't really want...but happy anyway because I know I'll be getting the right one in two weeks, no strings attached.Life lesson: if it sounds too good to be true, it is.Two weeks go by -- no phone call. I start calling The Magically Disappearing Amy Jones on her private cell number. I leave messages. My calls are never returned. Finally, I call the store and ask if they've gotten any of the red ones in stock. Oh, of course they have, weeks ago. Great.I drop everything and book it to the store since I have a very narrow timeframe for replacing the phone free of charge, and I don't want them to run out again. It's a Thursday. There's hardly anyone in the store. No one greets me when I walk in, so I put my name on the automated wait list. Around that time, two employees wander over to the front of the store (near where I'm standing) and start chatting with each other. I walk up to them and ask if they're free to help me.""No, we're in charge of the front of the store right now.""Um. Wow. Okay. See, cuz it looked like you were just chatting with each other and totally ignoring everyone who walks in, just like you ignored me. And you know, is the store REALLY that busy in the middle of a Thursday afternoon that they need TWO employees greeting people? (Answer: no.)Whatever. I start playing games on one of the display phones until my name finally reaches the top of the wait list and someone comes over to help me. I explain my situation. He goes to get the red phone.""That'll be a $20 restocking fee.""As Will Smith would say, awww HELL NO. Of course, The Magically Disappearing Amy Jones is nowhere to be found and is not answering her phone; the employee helping me today hasn't even heard of her. He says it doesn't matter anyway because there's no way she could have promised me to switch out a phone for free; apparently the $20 fee is in the fine print on the back of the receipt.I'm so annoyed at this point by the crappy customer service that I just want to get out of there. I pay the $20, take my new phone, and drive across 75 to the Northpark food court for a therapeutic cherry limeade at Sonic. And then my new phone rings. It's not anyone from my address book. I answer it (only then remembering that curiosity killed the cat).""Hi, Anne? This is QueenBitch at AT&T [can't you hear it in my voice?]. When StupidEmployee was helping you, he accidentally put your old phone back in the box with the new one. We need you to bring it back to the store sometime today.""AWWW HELL NO. I haven't even gotten my limeade yet. In fact, I've just barely found a parking spot and made it through the doors at Northpark. I am so pissed, I seriously contemplate stealing that second phone. Then I remember they know how to track me down, so reason prevails and I -- grumblingly -- turn around, go back outside, walk all the way back to my car, and prepare to head back to the AT&T store.Before I give up my parking spot, however, I open the box to check for the phone. I don't remember the guy putting the old one back in there. Sure enough, he didn't.Now I am REALLY pissed. I call the lady back. I tell her there is no such phone in the box. She puts me on hold. Then she comes back and apologizes, saying that there was a mistake in the inventory.I miraculously refrain from biting her head off. I get BACK out of my car. I go BACK inside Northpark.

Here's my feedback of how that conversation went : The rep was extremely rude after a few Initial discussions. She kept rushing me and suggested that I should hang up on my husband who I was talking to simultaneously so we could decide to buy t new iPhone. She hit on ""I accept"" option when it should have been me; just to hurry me up, it was abt 8.30 so may be was in a hurry to go home. She told me not to read the disclaimers because they were available online and could be read out of the store. She got so pushy that at one pony I had to ask her to relax. I almost walked out of the store without purchasing the phone because of her.

YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL CUSTOMER CARE INSTEAD OF WALKING INTO THIS STORE***Horrible Service and you can find the least knowledgeable customer executives here.It was a pain to get the connection from these people as a first time user few months ago and now when I walked in for an upgrade they tell me I am not the account holder on my own account and wanted me to call customer care. Why would I do that If I knew you guys would not be of any help in store to me?. If you think you have enough time to take their BS go out there and wait for hours while they eventually come back after an hour telling you that only customer care can help you with your case. This is another disappointing experience within a span of 4-6 months. I would never visit this store ever again and not recommend it either.THANK YOU AT&T .

Fortunately for me, I didn't have to do either of those things.I arrived around 6PM on a Thursday. There were maybe a dozen customers there already but everyone was being helped. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and asked what I was there for. I told her that I was interested in getting a new phone and immediately I was introduced to Fatima. We walked to the back of the store to sit down and we discussed what I was wanted. She made sure every one of my questions were answered. And when she tried to sell me extras she didn't make me feel like I was being pressured to say yes.After maybe 45 minutes, I was done.

This AZT&T is attached to an AT&T service center that also handles support issues.  This is a review for both.My Overall Rating:AT&T Retail - 3 1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Facility, Return)AT&T Support - 3 Stars (Service, Facility, Return)Atmosphere - Retail - You're greeted at the door a huge floor showcasing technology. It's really great and gives you the same vibe heading into a car dealership. Lots of nice shiny toys await! 1 Star.Support - Usually there's a line, and customers there looks tired, bored, or like they would rather be somewhere else. Look, if you're here chances are your phone is broken so expect a darker mood. No Stars.Service - Retail - You are greeted at the door and signed in. Once it's your turn, a sales associate will help you with all your needs. For the most part they are helpful. What I find is they're not really that objective, and tend to try to steer you to the most expensive device, not the one that's best for you. One poor lady had an iPhone 3GS, and wanted something basic and similar. Instead of offering the iPhone 5c, he insisted she HAD to get a 5s with NEXT. Also, if you are in the U-verse zip code, expect a STRONG pitch. Even if you say no they will persist. But they are friendly in my experiences. The last thing that is slightly annoying is you'll be reminded to fill out a survey. Some associates have really pushed to make sure you'll give them a good score. Guess what? If you're honest & helpful you'll get great scores, so stop pressuring me.  1/2 Star.Support - Usually it's a really long wait, but once you get to a tech they're very helpful. Unfortunately I have had to use them several times, and except for the wait, they're very professional and will do what they can within your contract. 1 1/2 Star.Facility - Retail - This AT&T store has a great layout. It's a very open space, with individual tables for customers, a few couches to watch U-Verse, and several areas showcasing their phones and technology. It doesn't feel cramped and is quite refreshing. It would be nice to have more seats for waiting when it gets busy. 1 Star.Support - Pretty much just a room with two long benches for waiting. At least you can watch TV. 1/2 Star.Will I Return? - Yes (to both). As far as the retail side goes, I'm an A&T customer and they seem to have the best phones. Although they are expensive and will push U-verse and NEXT on you, the associates are friendly. Also, the Support team (once it's your turn) are professional and will try to do whatever they can for you. It would be nice if all phones lasted forever, but it is what it is. 1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive? Perhaps an upscale place? No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.2 Stars - Service - You can have a great car with bad service. But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four. It's important to the experience that service is great and on point.1 Star - Facility - I'll award 1 stars for the facility, since this is one reason we go out. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except service (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

This store is always very crowded, not to say this is anyone's particular fault, just a populated area. Most of the employees that have helped me throughout the last few years have been friendly and knowledgeable. Although today was no exception, the attitude my husband and I received from the employee, although seemingly knowledgeable, was absurd. I'm also not your average consumer dummy, nor a ""hipster techie"" that thinks I know more than I don't.

Yet still, I can't help but salute this employees deliberate attempts to show us how disgusted she was that we exist. I would also like to add that we are your typical ""nice customers.""

She had a gift card and wanted to use it to purchase the new iPhone and renew her contract. The first sign of trouble showed itself when the greeter opened the door for us. As she was not dressed for inclement weather and it was surprisingly cold outside, I commented, ""You kinda got the crummy job tonight!"" in a jovial tone, whereupon she looked at me with disdain and sneered, ""I'm just opening the door for you"".Okay... odd, but likely being in the cold wasn't leaving her in a great mood. I dismissed it and we moved to the cheerful router, who sent us to meet our specialist for the evening, Tennyson.Once we were seated I sat quietly while my wife began explaining what she was after, and while the agent's answers were curt, they weren't rude up until the point where my wife indicated 'she will be upgrading too'.This stopped the process dead in its tracks as Tennyson made it a point to stop what he was doing and look up, then around. ""She? Who you talkin about? Is there another woman here? You said she, it confused me.""There were three of us at the table. No mistaking his 'confusion'.I'm a transsexual. So is my wife. And snide little asides like this are not something that I pay for when seeking services. When the agent went out of his way to insure that he had made his feelings about me abundantly clear, I chuckled. It isn't the first time I have ever run into a bigot, nor do I suspect it will be my last. But it is the first time I have encountered one in an AT&T store. He went to the back, collecting a few more of the black polo-shirted agents as well, glancing over his shoulder at us and snickering.I convinced my wife that our money would be best spent elsewhere. She made an excuse about not having the pin for the card on her person when he finally returned and we left, though in truth I would have been far more content to just walk out. The longer I thought about his pointed insult the more irritated that I became.I work as a manager, and I have to answer to my customers for the actions of my employees. Transphobic behavior such as this is intolerable in the 21st century, yet there it was, and I suspect will remain. I expect a degree of professionalism out of AT&T, and their representatives. If I want to be insulted by a frat boy for not adhering to his personal standards of feminine beauty then I will go to a fraternity party, not an AT&T store. We did buy a new phone, from another location where we were treated with respect and dignity. And quite frankly, we won't be returning to the AT&T store at Colin Creek, because if that is who they employ then they clearly do not need our business. Nor anyone that of anyone else who will listen to us. I'll be reposting this to Yelp and Google as well, and I will cheerfully tell anyone else who will listen to avoid this location.We will remain with AT&T because we have contracts.

I do not believe they will be helpful or honest. So I called att customer service again and was told they couldn't do anything about my iPad mini contract unless I wanted to pay for early termination fee of $146. They did offer to ameliorate the situation by increasing my phone data by 1 GB and reducing the payment by $10. So essentially I would be paying the same amount per month as if I didn't have the iPad mini plan. Plus 1 extra GB. that does make me feel somewhat better. I just wish I didn't have to go thru this in the first place. And I am strongly considering switching to T-Mobile for my cell phone because of my bad experience at this store.

I would take those negative reviews as anomalies. Over time they will become the minority opinion if they keep up the good work here.",Negative,99.9161,5,Yelp

Granted, not the best day to write a review about a store, but I'm still miffed enough to give my opinion.My mom had gotten me the iPhone 4 two weeks before the iPhone 5 was going to come out, so I immediately called AT&T and asked if I could trade it in and pay the difference. They told me yes, and I had to pay a $30 re-stocking fee.Sure, whatever, I just wanted an iPhone 5 (my first smart phone!) So I called this store around 11 that Friday morning to ask if they had any iPhones left (I had class in the morning) and was told yes, they had a few left. So I raced over to the store, checked in, and eagerly waited. Once I was directed to an employee, I explained my situation. She told me she was not sure that they could do that and went to talk to her manager. Once she came back, she said her manager had approved the request and went on to input the information in the system. And then--screech--""oh, this is the iPhone 4? This is a clearance item, we can't return clearance items.""...I had definitely confirmed with AT&T customer service that I had an iPhone 4 and I was allowed to do the trade-in. She went to talk to her manager again and said he agreed with her and she would not do the exchange. She suggested I go back to the AT&T store where I made the purchase to see if they would do the exchange for me. So I live in Richardson, and I ended up having to drive all the way to Fairview where I did not even ask if they had iPhone 5s available--I just wanted to know if they would trade it in for me. They said yes, they could do that and they did not know why the other AT&T store would not do the exchange.This mess would have been fine except for the vast difference in customer service I experienced in Plano vs Fairview. The Plano store employee was pretty curt and unhelpful, and she would not let me speak to the manager about my situation.",Negative,100.0000,2,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",5/14/2013,"Customer service is terrible. I am just so happy that I ordered my iPhone 5 via AT&T's call center rather than dealing with these lousy people. My iPhone came in the mail and I immediately went to this store to just get a case. That's it. Upon browsing for the particular case I want, it seems that the specific color I need for the brand wasn't there. I stood like an idiot smack in the middle of the store searching for an available employee who can assist me. I'm not exaggerating, but I swear my eyes caught up to 4 employees just standing around in the corner chilling, texting and chatting. I know they know they see me see them - if that makes any sense. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their name, but I was last here late afternoon on Tuesday (05/14). There was a guy there, about 6ft tall, a bit buffed with dark blond hair. I know he saw me and I tried to give out the nonverbal signal that I needed help. He nodded at me and resumed to text on his phone, and started to just hang out by the wall. Am I a non-existent invaluable customer? I guess they didn't take into account that I can write a bad review on one of the most trusted review sites - not that they'd actually care, obviously. They didn't even seem like they wanted to help me. They were rude even when I did talk to them. Anyway, regarding the case I wanted, I took the initiative to approach the people not doing their job and they just said whatever's out is out. Whatever. I just went ahead and bought the next case of choice.",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",2/17/2013,Customer service is the biggest thing in any buiness. I found that everytime I visited this location that I have had a great experiance in that field. Everyone that helped me was very nice and friendly. Although not much bigger than any other ATT store this one is in a nice location which makes it easier to go to.,Positive,63.8435,3,Yelp
Dallas9,33.009892,-96.709061,"701 N Central Expy Plano, TX 75075 ",10/10/2012,"I have been to the location just outside of Collin Creek mall (near Fridays) and inside of the mall. Both experiences were extremely negative. When I went to the one near the mall, I spoke with a sales man named Fadi. He was constantly up selling, not listening to our needs what so ever and was completely rude when he was unable to convince us towards unnecessary products and services. At one point he even physically blocked my husband out of the conversation with his body! It was a pretty terrible and an uncomfortable situation. When I went into Collin Creek Mall, the woman was too busy texting and seemed bothered. As I asked questions about the plan, she continued to text and not make eye contact. When I started to leave, that is when she decided to see if I was looking to start that day....Uh no thanks...",Negative,100.0000,1,Yelp
